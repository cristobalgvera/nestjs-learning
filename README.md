# Learning project

This branch was created following a NestJS Udemy course. So, project structure is not the focus right now.

## TL;DR

- Database: PostgreSQL
- Backend: NestJS
- Frontend: React _(not developed by me)_
- Deploy: [AWS](http://nestjs-learning-task-management-frontend.s3-website-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com)

_The server may not work depending on the date this is read._
